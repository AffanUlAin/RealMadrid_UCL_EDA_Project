The project examines key player statistics from the 2021-22 UEFA Champions League to dissect Real Madrid's victory. Metrics such as goals, assists, and tackles won shed light on individual and team performances. Through univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis, the project aims to unravel the dynamics behind Real Madrid's success. The dataset is available on Kaggle for further exploration.

The "Data_Analysis_File.R" is an R-programming file designed for execution in RStudio. It requires specifying the dataset directory. This file outlines step-by-step procedures, starting with univariate analysis across different player roles, followed by bivariate analysis utilizing Pearson Correlation Analysis to understand variable correlations. Lastly, multivariate analysis is conducted on the four semi-finalists of the UCL 2021-22 using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to assess their gameplay.

All findings and analyses are documented comprehensively in the "Analysis Report.pdf" file. It presents structured plots alongside detailed descriptions of the dataset, research question, employed techniques, and interpretation of results.
